Multi line grid columns only need one wrapper, not one for each line, and can contain different amount of content. this is important responsive design, as you can see in the example.

Append size suffixes to the width classes to target widths:

* `-xs`: max. 479px
* `-sm`: max. 719px
* `-md`: max. 979px
* `-lg`: min. 1280px

Per default, columns are top-aligned, but they can also be aligned to middle, bottom or baseline.
